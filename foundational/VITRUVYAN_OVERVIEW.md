# Vitruvyan — Epistemic Operating System

## What Is Vitruvyan?

Vitruvyan is a **modular cognitive architecture** for building AI systems that can perceive, reason, remember, communicate, and self-govern. It is not an application — it is the substrate on which domain-specific intelligent agents are built.

> Note (Feb 14, 2026): this page is an **architectural overview**. Some parts describe **design intent** (target), while others reflect **current runtime**. For the most precise “what is active today”, use `docs/foundational/VITRUVYAN_PIPELINE_WALKTHROUGH.md`.

Think of it this way:
- **Linux** is an operating system for hardware. It provides processes, memory management, filesystems, and IPC — but knows nothing about what applications you run on it.
- **Vitruvyan** is an operating system for cognition. It provides perception, memory, reasoning, discourse, and truth governance — but knows nothing about the domain you apply it to.

The first domain specialization (codename **Mercator**) is financial analysis. But the architecture is deliberately **domain-agnostic**: the same modules could power a medical diagnostic advisor, a legal research agent, or an industrial monitoring system.

## The Five Sacred Orders

Vitruvyan organizes all components into five **epistemic orders** — each responsible for a distinct cognitive function. This is not just labeling; it is an **architectural constraint**: modules respect their order's boundaries, and cross-order communication follows strict protocols.

### 1. Perception — *"What is out there?"*

**Codex Hunters** are a team of specialized agents that collect, clean, and persist data:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Tracker** | Fetches raw data from external sources (APIs, feeds, scrapers) with rate limiting |
| **Restorer** | Deduplicates (hash-based), cleans (removes noise, normalizes text), and imputes missing fields |
| **Binder** | Dual-writes to PostgreSQL (structured) and Qdrant (vector embeddings via MiniLM-L6-v2) |
| **Scribe** | Computes derived indicators from raw data (e.g., moving averages, oscillators) |
| **Cartographer** | Builds consistency maps across databases, generates audit reports |
| **Expedition Planner** | Schedules data collection intelligently (5 priority levels, resource-aware) |
| **Expedition Leader** | Coordinates all agents with 5 command levels (ROUTINE → CRISIS) |
| **Event Hunter** | Bridges Codex Hunters to the Cognitive Bus — triggers Track→Restore→Bind cycles automatically on events |

### 2. Memory — *"What do I already know?"*

Two canonical storage systems with **mandatory access patterns**:

- **PostgreSQL** — Relational source of truth. Accessed **exclusively** through `PostgresAgent`. Direct `psycopg2.connect()` calls are forbidden.
- **Qdrant** — Vector semantic memory (384-dim embeddings). Accessed **exclusively** through `QdrantAgent`. Every point must carry a valid ISO 639-1 language tag — the agent rejects `null`, `unknown`, or `auto`.
- **Memory Orders** — A reconciliation service that keeps PostgreSQL and Qdrant in sync (drift monitoring, periodic sync).

### 3. Reason — *"What can I deduce?"*

- **Neural Engine** — A domain-agnostic evaluation substrate. Defines three abstract contracts:
  - `AbstractFactor`: computes a signal for an entity (e.g., momentum, risk, quality)
  - `NormalizerStrategy`: makes heterogeneous values comparable (z-score, rank, min-max)
  - `AggregationProfile`: weights factors into a composite score

  The `EvaluationOrchestrator` executes the pipeline: *compute → normalize (cross-entity) → aggregate → package*. The core knows nothing about what an "entity" or "factor" means in your domain — that knowledge lives in **verticals**.

- **Execution wiring note (runtime)**: the LangGraph `exec` step in core is currently **domain-neutral** (a stub/passthrough). A vertical is expected to provide the domain execution hook (e.g., call Neural Engine, tools, or a domain service) and/or enable the MCP dispatcher path.

- **Plasticity** — Bounded adaptive learning. System parameters (thresholds, weights) can evolve, but within structural limits with full audit trail. Not unsupervised ML — governed adaptation.

### 4. Discourse — *"How do I explain this?"*

- **Babel Gardens** — Multilingual semantic fusion engine (84 languages). Combines multiple AI models (FinBERT, Gemma, MiniLM) into unified semantic representations. Handles sentiment analysis, language detection, and embedding generation through a single API.

- **Pattern Weavers** — Contextual enrichment via vector search. Transforms vague human queries into structured context: *"analyze European banks"* becomes `{concepts: ["Banking"], regions: ["Europe"], countries: [IT, FR, DE...]}`. Reduces conversational friction by 50-66%.

  > **Note**: Pattern Weavers is architecturally a **Perception** Sacred Order (ontology resolution via taxonomy matching), but appears in the Discourse layer during conversational understanding. This dual-use reflects its role: pure semantic mapping (Perception) applied to conversational enrichment (Discourse).

- **VEE (Vitruvyan Explainability Engine)** — Three-level narrative generation:
  1. **Summary**: Plain language, zero jargon
  2. **Detailed**: Operational depth, strategy implications
  3. **Technical**: Raw scores, factor convergence, full transparency

- **CAN (Conversational Agent Node)** — Generates natural-language responses with anti-hallucination validation via MCP bridge.

### 5. Truth — *"Is this correct? Is it coherent?"*

- **Orthodoxy Wardens** — Every output is validated before reaching the user. Verdicts: `blessed` (clean), `purified` (corrected with warnings), `heretical` (rejected).
- **Vault Keepers** — Immutable versioned archive of significant events. The governance layer can emit **archival directives** that include a `blockchain` destination, but chain anchoring is an optional/vertical-specific integration (not guaranteed by the core runtime).

> **Note**: Sentinel (risk monitoring) is a **finance vertical extension**, not part of the domain-agnostic core V1.0. See Appendix D for vertical-specific governance patterns.

## The Cognitive Bus (Synaptic Conclave)

The nervous system that connects all orders. Built on **Redis Streams** with durable, ordered, causally-linked delivery.

**Bio-inspired design**:
- Modeled after the **octopus nervous system**: 2/3 of neurons reside in the arms (local autonomy), only 1/3 in the brain (minimal governance)
- Modeled after **fungal mycelial networks**: no central processor, emergent routing, topological resilience

**Four sacred invariants** — the bus is *deliberately unintelligent*:
1. Never inspects payloads
2. Never correlates events
3. Never performs semantic routing
4. Never synthesizes or transforms data

Intelligence belongs in consumers, not the network.

**Communication pattern**:
```
Publisher → Herald.publish("channel.name", event_data)
               │
               ▼
         Redis Streams (durable, ordered)
               │
               ▼
Consumer ← StreamBus.consume("channel.name", group, consumer_id)
               │
               ▼
         bus.acknowledge(event)  ← mandatory
```

Events use dot notation (`codex.discovery.mapped`, `babel.sentiment.fused`) and carry: `event_id`, `event_type`, `causation_id` (optional, for causal chains), `timestamp`, `data`, `metadata`.

---

## LangGraph — The Orchestrator

A `StateGraph` manages the full cognitive pipeline.

Current runtime (Feb 14, 2026):
- **Full graph**: 19 nodes
- **Minimal graph**: 4 nodes (feature-flagged)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[parse] --> B["intent<br/>detection"]
    B --> C["pattern<br/>weavers"]
    C --> D["entity<br/>resolver"]
    D --> E["babel<br/>emotion"]
    E --> F["semantic<br/>grounding"]
    F --> G["params<br/>extraction"]
    G --> H{decide}

    H -->|exec| I[exec]
    H -->|qdrant| J[qdrant]
    H -->|llm_soft| K[llm_soft]
    H -->|codex| M["codex<br/>hunters"]
    H -->|mcp| N[llm_mcp]

    I --> O["output<br/>normalizer"]
    J --> O
    K --> O
    M -.->|error| O
    N --> O

    O --> P["orthodoxy<br/>wardens"]
    P --> Q["vault<br/>keepers"]
    H -->|slot_filler| R[compose]
    Q --> R
    R --> S[CAN]
    S --> T((END))

    style H fill:#e53e3e,stroke:#c53030,color:#fff
    style T fill:#2f855a,stroke:#276749,color:#fff
```

Key design decisions:
- **Sacred Flow**: analysis results pass through `orthodoxy → vault → compose → CAN` before reaching the user — every output is validated and archived
- **Codex conditional routing** (updated Dec 27, 2025): Codex Hunters success routes directly to END (background work bypass), but errors route through `output_normalizer → Sacred Flow` for governance validation
- **Hook injection points (runtime)**: `entity_resolver` and `exec` are domain-agnostic and routed via registries (hook pattern). Without a configured vertical they degrade to stub behavior; with a vertical they execute domain logic.
- **`USE_MCP` flag**: can route execution through the MCP bridge for tool calling

## How Services Communicate

Services **never import each other's code**. Three communication channels:

| Channel | When | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **REST API** (httpx) | Synchronous request/response between Docker containers | LangGraph `exec` can call a vertical service (e.g., Neural Engine) when `EXEC_DOMAIN` is configured |
| **Redis Streams** | Asynchronous event propagation | Codex publishes `codex.discovery.mapped`, Babel Gardens consumes it |
| **LangGraph State** | Within the orchestration pipeline | `state["weaver_context"]` flows from Pattern Weavers node to Entity Resolver |

Each major service runs in its own Docker container on a shared network (`vitruvyan_omni_net`).

---

## Domain Specialization: Verticals

The core framework is domain-agnostic. **Verticals** inject domain knowledge:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              VITRUVYAN CORE                       │
│  Perception · Memory · Reason · Discourse · Truth │
│  ──────────────────────────────────────────────── │
│  Domain-agnostic substrate                        │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
          ┌────────────┼────────────┐
          ▼            ▼            ▼
    ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
    │ Mercator │ │ (future) │ │ (future) │
    │ Finance  │ │ Medical  │ │ Legal    │
    │          │ │          │ │          │
    │ Factors: │ │ Factors: │ │ Factors: │
    │ momentum │ │ BP risk  │ │ citation │
    │ trend    │ │ biomark. │ │ preceden │
    │ volatilit│ │ family h.│ │ jurisdic │
    │ sentim.  │ │ symptoms │ │ relevance│
    └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
```

A vertical provides:
- **Factors** for the Neural Engine (what to compute)
- **Data sources** for Codex Hunters (where to look)
- **Weaving rules** for Pattern Weavers (domain concepts and taxonomies)
- **Narrative templates** for VEE (how to explain results)
- **Validation rules** for Orthodoxy Wardens (domain-specific correctness)

The core never changes. The vertical plugs in.

## Key Architectural Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **No single point of failure** | Autonomous services, event-driven, graceful degradation |
| **Canonical data access** | `PostgresAgent` and `QdrantAgent` are the only database interfaces |
| **Intelligence at the edges** | The bus is dumb, consumers are smart |
| **Epistemic governance** | Every output validated (Orthodoxy), every event archived (Vault) |
| **Bounded adaptation** | Plasticity allows evolution within structural limits |
| **Biological metaphors** | Octopus (local autonomy), mycelium (emergent routing), medieval scholars (knowledge orders) |
| **Explainability by design** | VEE produces 3 depth levels for every output |

## TL;DR

Vitruvyan is a **cognitive operating system** that separates *how to think* from *what to think about*. Five epistemic orders (Perception, Memory, Reason, Discourse, Truth) communicate through a deliberately unintelligent event bus. A domain-neutral LangGraph pipeline orchestrates 19 nodes (full graph). Domain knowledge is injected through verticals, not hardcoded. Every output is validated, archived, and explainable at three depth levels.
